# Guess the Number Game ðŸŽ²

A simple and interactive Java-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected number within a limited number of attempts. The game provides hints and calculates the score based on performance. 

## How to Play
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The player has 5 attempts to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the game provides feedback:
   - **"Very close!"**: Your guess is within 2 of the target number.
   - **"Close!"**: Your guess is within 5 of the target number.
   - **"Too low!"**: Your guess is smaller than the target number.
   - **"Too high!"**: Your guess is larger than the target number.
4. If you guess correctly, you earn points based on your remaining attempts.
5. You can choose to play multiple rounds, and your score accumulates over the session.
